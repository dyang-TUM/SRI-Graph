# SRI-Graph: A Novel Scene-Robot Interaction Graph for Robust Scene Understanding

This is the implementation of the paper SRI-Graph: A Novel Scene-Robot Interaction Graph for Robust Scene Understanding (ICRA 2023). This repository will be updated soon.

# Introduction

We propose an annotation tool LabelImg-Rel (based on [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg)) for convenient and efficient relationship annotation. We release a new dataset named 3DRF-Pos, it contains the RGB images and corresponding 3D positions of the robot manipulator during the real-world 3D robot-feeding teleoperation task.

# LabelImg-Rel

## Installation

Python 3 or above are required.

```
pip3 install PyQt5 lxml
```
