# SRI-Graph: A Novel Scene-Robot Interaction Graph for Robust Scene Understanding

This is the implementation of the paper SRI-Graph: A Novel Scene-Robot Interaction Graph for Robust Scene Understanding (ICRA 2023).

# Introduction

We propose an annotation tool LabelImg-Rel (based on [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg)) for convient and efficient relationship annotation. We release a new dataset named 3DRF-Pos, it contains the RGB images and corresponding 3D positions of the robot manipulator during the real-world 3D robot-feeding teleoperation task.
